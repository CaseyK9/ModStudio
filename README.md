# ModStudio
Old ETS2/ATS Mod Studio website that was created by me for the edited version of ETS2 Studio that I repurposed.

No this is not a redistribution of Roadside Studio's project, it is simply a website I made for educatgional purposes. Any links in the source code have been removed and are now dead. No downloads for Roadside Studio's mod studio are hosted on my domain https://doggidada.space/

If for whatever reason you need to contact me in case any downloads or files of their intellectual property are found on my server, you're welcome to contact me on Discord Ca$ey#0001 or email me casey.maxwell017 (at) gmail (dot) com and I will remove them from my web server immediatelly.
